# Baraja MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects Claude Desktop to your local Anki instance via AnkiConnect. Enables Claude to create, manage, and search flashcards directly in your Anki decks.

> **Note:** While this MCP works with any Anki collection, many features and examples are geared towards Spanish language learning.

## Features

- **Health Check**: Verify Anki and AnkiConnect are running
- **Deck Management**: List and create decks
- **Flashcard Creation**: Add single or batch flashcards
- **Cloze Deletions**: Create cloze deletion cards for sentence learning
- **Search**: Find existing notes using Anki's search syntax
- **Sync**: Trigger AnkiWeb synchronization
- **Statistics & Analytics**: Deck stats, collection overview, study streaks, retention metrics, learning curves
- **Card Management**: Suspend/unsuspend cards, update content, delete notes, move cards between decks, manage tags
- **Problem Detection**: Identify struggling cards with low ease or high lapse counts
- **Scheduling Control**: View due cards, reset card progress, adjust ease factors
- **Spanish Helpers**: Built-in utilities for formatting Spanish vocabulary cards

## Prerequisites

Before using this MCP server, you need:

1. **Anki Desktop** - Download from [ankiweb.net](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
2. **AnkiConnect Add-on** - Install from Anki:
   - Open Anki
   - Go to Tools → Add-ons → Get Add-ons
   - Enter code: `2055492159`
   - Restart Anki
3. **Python 3.11+** - Required for running the server
4. **uv** - Python package manager (optional but recommended)

### Verify AnkiConnect is Running

After installing AnkiConnect, verify it's working:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8765
```

You should see: `"AnkiConnect v.6"`

## Installation

### Option 1: Using uv (Recommended)

**uv** is a fast Python package manager. If you don't have it, [install it first](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jbkroner/baraja-mcp.git
cd baraja-mcp

# Install dependencies and create virtual environment
uv sync
```

### Option 2: Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jbkroner/baraja-mcp.git
cd baraja-mcp

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop Setup

Add this to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

#### If installed with uv:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anki": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/absolute/path/to/baraja-mcp",
        "baraja-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/baraja-mcp` with the actual path to this directory.

#### If installed with pip/venv:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anki": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/baraja-mcp/.venv/bin/baraja-mcp-server",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Restart Claude Desktop

After updating the configuration, completely quit and restart Claude Desktop for changes to take effect.

### `suggest_tags()`
Suggests appropriate tags based on:
- Part of speech
- Verb characteristics (reflexive, irregular, etc.)
- Custom categories

│   ├── Present
│   ├── Past
│   └── Irregular
└── Sentences/
    └── Cloze
```

## Recommended Tags

## Development

### Running Tests

# Make sure Anki is running with AnkiConnect
uv run pytest

# Or with pip
pytest
```

**Note:** Tests require Anki to be running with AnkiConnect installed. They will create test decks in your collection.

```

## Troubleshooting

### "AnkiConnect error" messages

**Solution:** Make sure Anki is running and AnkiConnect is installed. Test with:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8765
```

### Cards not appearing in Anki

**Solution:** Check that:
1. The deck name is correct (case-sensitive)
2. You're looking in the right deck
3. Anki is in the main window (not the browser)

### MCP server not connecting

**Solution:**
1. Verify the path in Claude Desktop config is absolute (not relative)
2. Check that `uv` or `python` is in your system PATH
3. Restart Claude Desktop completely
4. Check Claude Desktop logs for errors

### Duplicate cards being skipped

**Solution:** This is expected behavior. AnkiConnect prevents duplicate cards. Use `search_notes` to find existing cards.
